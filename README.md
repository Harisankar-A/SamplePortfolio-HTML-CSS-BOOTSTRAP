## Limitations

- **Dynamic Content**: The content is static and needs to be manually updated for new projects or achievements.
- **Image Paths**: Ensure that images like `Profile.jpeg` and other assets are placed correctly in the project directory.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Some parts of the site may need further tweaks for mobile optimization, though the responsive design is handled by Bootstrap.
